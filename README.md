# DeepSeek-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on the DeepSeek review dataset (~15,000 reviews) to classify user sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. Ratings were mapped to sentiment labels (0-1: negative, 2-3: neutral, 4-5: positive). It included advanced preprocessing (translation, lemmatization, emoji handling), a TextBlob baseline, and a custom logistic regression classifier with improvements like SMOTE for class imbalance, TF-IDF with n-grams, and hyperparameter tuning. Visualizations compared TextBlob and the custom classifier against rating-based labels. The custom classifier achieved F1-scores of 0.92 (positive), 0.75 (negative), and 0.19 (neutral), outperforming TextBlob, which overpredicted neutral sentiment. Challenges remain with the neutral class due to its underrepresentation and short review lengths. Future work could explore transformer models for better performance.
